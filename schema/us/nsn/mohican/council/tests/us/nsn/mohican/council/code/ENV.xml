        <heading>Purpose.</heading>
        <text>The purpose of this policy is to refine the bidding process for sales of forest products by the Tribe and the BIA. The intent of this Policy is to facilitate the Tribe in obtaining the best possible timber sales, consistent with federal law, while encouraging Tribal loggers to participate in the bidding process in a meaningful manner.</text>

          <text>An Approved Tribal Logger whose bid is within 10% of the highest submitted bid, shall be required to match the highest submitted bid, with the understanding that the Tribe will rebate the matched amount (with no interest) upon successful completion of the timber sale.</text>

            <text>Tribal Logger bids #3		$ 87,000</text>
            <text>Tribal Logger #3 bid is too low to be considered for preference.  The bid is below the 10% maximum difference to be considered for the sale.</text>
            <text>Tribal Logger bid #1 is within the 10% maximum difference.  However, Tribal Logger bid #2 is the higher bid between the eligible Tribal Loggers.  Therefore, Tribal Logger Bid #1 does not receive the timber sale contract.</text>
            <text>Tribal Logger bid #2 is the highest preference bid with the 10% maximum difference.  #2 would be required to match the $100,000 bid, but will receive a rebate of $6,000 upon the successful completion of the timber sale.</text>
            <text>Timber Company ABC would not get the timber sale contract because Tribal Logger bid #2 would be awarded the timber sale contract.  Because Tribal Logger #2's bid is within 10% of the highest bid (Timber Company ABC), and it would match the $4,000 difference, Timber Company ABC and Tribal Logger #2 are essentially bidding at $100,000.</text>
