      <heading>Council Findings And Purpose</heading>
      <text>Tribal Council finds that the Community will benefit from regulations governing safe use of ATVs.  Tribal Council finds that unregulated use of ATVs, especially within populated areas such as housing areas, creates a safety hazard for the operator, pedestrians, residents, automobiles, and others.  Tribal Council also finds that unregulated use of ATVs threatens or directly affects the political integrity, the economic security, and/or the health and welfare of the Community.  Tribal Council also reaffirms that it is a general policy to promote safety and protection for persons, property, and environment.</text>
