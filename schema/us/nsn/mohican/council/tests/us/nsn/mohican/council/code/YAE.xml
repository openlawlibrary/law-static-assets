        <text>The purpose of this Ordinance is to establish the legal responsibility of parents to provide financially for their children's general well-being.  The Stockbridge-Munsee Community finds its children are among the Tribe's most valuable resources and their financial needs must be met to ensure their success in the future. Therefore, it is the intent of the Tribe to define a process to establish, modify and enforce child support court orders involving members of the Stockbridge-Munsee Community, and all those subject to the jurisdiction of the Stockbridge-Munsee Community.</text>

        <text>The Stockbridge-Munsee Community authorized the creation of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Child Support Agency (SMTCSA) (Agency) and hereby delegates to that Agency, through the Child Support Manager the responsibility and authority for implementing, monitoring and enforcing this Law.  Included in this delegation of authority is rule-making authority to facilitate enforcement of child support orders and obligations.  The enforcement authority delegated under this section includes the authority to make rules that govern the compliance of other tribal departments, businesses, agencies, boards, committees or other tribal entity that may be in a position to facilitate the collection or enforcement of child support obligations.  An example of a Tribal Child Support Agency rule affecting a tribal department might, for instance, be a rule that requires the loan department to either deny a tribal loan in cases where a noncustodial parent payor was more than one month in arrears on child support payments or grant the loan conditioned on a portion of that loan being used to satisfy the outstanding child support arrears.</text>

        <text>In general, the Tribe must adhere to federal law and state law by conducting criminal background checks on employees and volunteers who work with youth.

          <num>(1)</num>
          <text>Tribal Council recognizes that elders and youth are vulnerable members of the Community who should not be placed at risk by being placed in the care of persons who may have a propensity to harm elders/youth.  Tribal Council finds that in the interest of ensuring that elders/youth utilizing tribal services are not exposed to individuals who have a propensity to harm elders/youth, an individual desiring a position with elders/youth is subject to a background investigation and must obtain an elder/youth license.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(2)</num>
          <text>Tribal Council also recognizes the importance of optimal employment opportunities to the Community.  Tribal Council finds that if an applicant is unable to obtain an elder/youth license, the applicant should not automatically be denied other employment within the same facility, or for other positions within the Tribe.  Tribal Council recognizes that specific employment duties for one position may require an elder/youth license while another position within the same facility may not require a license.</text>

In general, the Ella Besaw Center, the Health Center, the Day Care Center, Head Start, and the Family Center are within the scope of licensing.  However, this Ordinance is intended to include other Tribal departments, agencies, entities, or persons if they have regular contact or control over elders/youth, or if other Tribal/federal/state laws are applicable.</text>
