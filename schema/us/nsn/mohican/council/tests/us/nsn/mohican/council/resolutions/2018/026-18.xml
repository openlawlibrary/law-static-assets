        <annotation type="Legislative History">3. On March 6, 2018, in Resolution #026-18, the Tribal Council rescinded the existing Chapter 57 (Construction Tax Ordinance) and Chapter 57-A (Room Tax Ordinance) to adopt a new Tax Ordinance as Chapter 57. The new Chapter 57 establishes a more comprehensive tribal tax regime that incorporated both a sales tax and a hotel occupancy tax, as well as the related administrative process. The Tribe affirmed its adoption of the ordinance on January 21, 2021 in Resolution #017-21 after the BIA declined to act for timeliness. The new Tax Ordinance was approved by the BIA on January 28, 2021.</annotation>
