  <annotations>
    <annotation type="Legislative History">Amendments incorporating the original 2015 revisions plus additional changes.  Tribal Council did not feel an additional comment period was necessary since changes primarily incorporated technical corrections required per NIGC.  Amendments submitted to NIGC for approval on January 7, 2016.  NIGC informed Tribe that additional corrections were needed so that language satisfies federal regulations.  Tribe withdrew ordinance from review by NIGC on February 17, 2016.</annotation>
