        <heading>Application of Federal Policy.</heading>
        <text>In 1970, President Nixon announced the policy of the United States Government to promote self-determination for Indian tribes. At the heart of this policy is a commitment by the federal government to foster and encourage tribal self-government, economic development and self-sufficiency. That commitment was signed into law in 1975 as the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Public Law 93-638, 88 Stat. 2203, 25 U.S.C. Sections 450-450n. In 1983, President Reagan reaffirmed that commitment in his Indian Policy Statement, encouraged tribes to reduce their dependence on federal funds by generating more of their own revenues and pledged to assist tribes in that endeavor.  In 1988 the federal commitment to promote tribal economic development, tribal self-sufficiency and strong tribal government was expressly legislated in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act ("IGRA"), Public Law 100-497, 102 Stat. 2426, 25 U.S.C. Section 2710, et. seq. (1988), which recognized the inherent sovereign right of tribes to operate and their exclusive right to regulate on Indian lands gaming that is not specifically prohibited by federal law and is conducted within a state that does not, as a matter of criminal law and public policy, prohibit such gaming, and provided a federal statutory basis for operation and regulation of Indian gaming.</text>

The Commission may take all necessary steps as authorized under this law to remedy an emergency violation.  In a case of revocation of the operator's license, the Commission shall provide notice to the NIGC, subjecting the Tribe to potential closure action.

The Commission shall create policy regarding additional standards of suitability and the application of those standards.  The following minimum standards and criteria shall be applied when determining an individual's suitability to obtain or retain a gaming license from the Commission.  These standards may be applied in any case where there is cause to question an individual's suitability, whether the cause arises from an individual's criminal history or from his/her reputation, habits and associations identified during the background investigation process.</text>

          <text>Criminal Offenses:  The Commission will view suitability for a license as diminishing in direct correlation to the increased severity of the offense or offenses that appear in one's record.  The Commission will take into account the severity of the crime and the number of crimes and other offenses that a person's background investigation reveals.  Some offenses are identified in the Gaming Ordinance as being an automatic bar to a gaming license.  In the event an individual's background investigation reveals a barring offense, they will be denied a gaming license.  They may be eligible to apply for, and obtain, a Tribal Gaming Waiver.</text>

These include but are not limited to violent acts against persons; verified reports or documented evidence of violence against persons without a criminal conviction; dishonest acts against an employee, person or institution with or without a criminal or ordinance violation; any type of verifiable wrong-doing that may present a threat or harm to the gaming establishment, its patrons or employees.</text>

        <heading>Judgments for Obligations Owed the Tribe.</heading>
        <text>The Stockbridge-Munsee Tribe may, in its discretion, determine that the per capita distribution may be withheld for payment to the Tribe for amounts due the Tribe and established by a court of competent jurisdiction by judgment with any remaining funds being distributed to the individual. In the event that the obligations of the tribal member are non-monetary then the tribal member's per-capita payment will be withheld until the individual satisfies the obligation. If the individual has failed to comply within thirty (30) days, then the tribal member's per-capita payment for that particular year will be returned to the Net Gaming Revenue's General Welfare Fund. Examples include but are not limited to a tribal member refusing to vacate a tribal housing unit, failing to complete community service, etc. In addition to any other tribal remedies, the tribal member's per-capita payment would be withheld. If the individual continued to fail to vacate or perform community service as required, then the tribal member's per-capita payment would be returned to the Net Gaming Revenue's General Welfare Fund.  Said withholding may be done by voluntary consent of the debtor or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction, even if the debtor chooses not to accept the per capita payment. In any event, all funds withheld shall be reported to the appropriate taxing authority as income for purposes of federal taxation.</text>
