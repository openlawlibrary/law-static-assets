        <text>The following title shall hereinafter be referred to as the Probate Code. The objective of the Probate Code is to provide for the exercise of the greatest possible tribal jurisdiction over the probate of the estate of decedents who were domiciled or owned real or personal property on the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Indian Reservation. The Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Council finds that probate procedure in the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Court is in the best interest of tribal members in that probate may be concluded more economically and more expeditiously than by other jurisdictions.  Furthermore, the determination of how property is disposed upon a person's death is an exercise of self-governance crucial to tribal sovereignty.</text>

        <aftertext>It is very useful to begin a probate code by getting forth the purpose and philosophy to guide the court in interpreting and applying the code. The Tribal Council should carefully review these objectives to determine whether these objectives are appropriate and consistent with the needs of the community.</aftertext>
        <aftertext><cite path="§6.1">Section 6.1</cite>.2 sets forth a long series of specific definitions due to the fact that probate law in general and Indian probate law specifically has a unique language which often needs explanation.</aftertext>
        <aftertext><cite path="§6.1">Section 6.1</cite>.3 provides for a broad statement of jurisdiction. It provides for the exercise of the greatest possible tribal jurisdiction over the probate of the estate of decedents who were domiciled or owned real or personal property on the Indian Reservation. Jurisdiction is not limited to Indian decedents or to tribal members. Instead, it allows the court to assert probate jurisdiction over anyone who was domiciled or owned real or personal property on the reservation. It does not mean that the court must assert jurisdiction in all of the potential cases - but it does give the court flexibility to assert jurisdiction when it is appropriate.</aftertext>
        <aftertext>Sections <cite path="§6.1">6.1</cite>.4 and <cite path="§6.1">6.1</cite>.5 allow for the use of tribal custom and tradition.  <cite path="§6.1">Section 6.1</cite>.4 is important because it allows anyone to renounce any property or interest and sets forth the procedure for renunciation of succession.</aftertext>
        <aftertext>The remaining sections are standard general probate provisions as follows:</aftertext>
        <aftertext><cite path="§6.1">Section 6.1</cite>.6 - Allows relief when fraud is involved</aftertext>
        <aftertext><cite path="§6.1">Section 6.1</cite>.7 - Provides procedure for determining evidence of death</aftertext>
        <aftertext><cite path="§6.1">Section 6.1</cite>.8 - Allows for use of civil procedure and appellate review when appropriate</aftertext>
        <aftertext><cite path="§6.1">Section 6.1</cite>.9 - Sets forth judicial powers and duties</aftertext>
        <aftertext><cite path="§6.1">Section 6.1</cite>.10 - Sets out rules for records and copies</aftertext>
        <aftertext><cite path="§6.1">Section 6.1</cite>.11 - Allows for trials to the court</aftertext>
