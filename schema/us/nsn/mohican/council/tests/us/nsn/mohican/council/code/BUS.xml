      <heading>Council Findings</heading>
      <text>Tribal Council finds that the Community will benefit from regulations governing the conduct of persons who are engaged in the business of door to door sales.  Door to door sales often involve the sales person contacting Tribal members at the Tribal Member's residence.  These sales contacts are often unsolicited and Tribal members and their families have indicated a desire to regulate the conduct of door to door sellers.  Unregulated door to door sellers threaten or directly affects the political integrity, the economic security, and/or the heath and welfare of the Tribe.</text>
